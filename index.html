  <header>How to use flexbox</header>
  <div id="main">
    <article>When working with flexbox you need to think in terms of two axes,the main axis and the cross axis. The main axis is defined by the flex-direction property, and the cross axis runs perpendicular to it. Everything we do with flexbox refers back to these axis.</article>
    <nav>When using flexbox it takes certain area to use and shares remaining space between others. If you change flexbox size, it also affects to other boxes.</nav>
    <aside>This defines a flex container; inline or block depending on the given value. It enables a flex context for all its direct children.</aside>
  </div>
  <footer>A key feature of flexbox is the ability to align and justify items on the main- and cross-axes, and to distribute space between flex items. Note that these properties are to be set on the flex container, not on the items themselves. There is many properties, example. flex-start, flex-end, center, space-around, space-between </footer>
